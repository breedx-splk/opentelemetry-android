# Session Instrumentation

Out of the box, the `opentelemetry-android` agent will create and manage sessions. Sessions are associated
with a unique identifier and will expire after a duration. This instrumentation is responsible
for adding a `SessionObserver` instance that will generate OpenTelemetry events for
`session.start` and `session.end` when interesting things happen to the session.

See [session.md in the semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/general/session.md)
for additional details about sessions.

See ["Session Events"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/general/session.md#session-events)
for more information about the specific events generated by this instrumentation.
